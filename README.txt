The most painfull thing about this is to install opencv
If you're using Pycharm just go to python packages and look for opencv-python... that's it

Use main to run the other 2 functions:

CameraDetect.py >>> Looks for colors and if its too dark it prints out "camera blocked"
CameraStatus.py >>> Is an example on how to detect if the camera is in use
MotionDetector1.py >>> Looks fqor motion by comparing 2 grey masks
